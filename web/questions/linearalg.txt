Q1: What are polynomials?
Answer: Polynomials are mathematical expressions consisting of variables and coefficients, which are combined using arithmetic operations. They can be added together, resulting in another polynomial, and multiplied by a scalar (a real number) to produce a polynomial. 
Q2: How are audio signals represented?
Answer: Audio signals are represented as a series of numbers. 
Q3: What is the concept of closure in mathematics?
Answer: The concept of closure in mathematics is the idea of finding the set of all things that can result from a given set of operations. In the case of vectors, these operations include adding them together and scaling them, which results in a vector space.
