Q: What is linear algebra?
A: Linear algebra is the study of vectors and certain algebraic rules to manipulate vectors.

Q1: What are polynomials?
A1: Polynomials are mathematical expressions consisting of variables and coefficients, which represent a sum of terms. They can be added together to form another polynomial and multiplied by a scalar to produce a polynomial as well. 
Q2: What is the concept of closure in mathematics?
A2: In mathematics, closure is the concept of creating a set of results from a given set of operations. For example, the set of all vectors that can result from adding and scaling a small set of vectors is a vector space.

Q1: What is the objective of the example in Section 2.1? 
A1: To find an optimal production plan, i.e., a plan of how many units of product should be produced with available resources and no resources left over.
Q2: What role does linear algebra play in machine learning? 
A2: Linear algebra plays an important role in machine learning by providing tools for solving problems formulated as systems of linear equations.

Q1: What is the general form of a system of linear equations? 
A1: The general form of a system of linear equations is a,ijxj=bi, where aij ∈ R and bi ∈ R. 
Q2: What is an example of a system that has no solution? 
A2: An example of a system with no solution is x1 + x2 + x3 = 3 (1), x1 − x2 + 2x3 = 2 (2), 2x1 + 3x3 = 1 (3).

Q1: What is the solution set of a system of two linear equations with two variables? 
A1: The solution set is the intersection of the two lines. 
Q2: What are the possible solutions to a real-valued system of linear equations? 
A2: No, exactly one, or infinitely many solutions.

Q1: What is a matrix?
A1: A matrix is an m x n tuple of elements a_ij, where i = 1,...,m and j = 1,...,n, ordered according to a rectangular scheme consisting of m rows and n columns.

Q: What is the definition of an identity matrix? 
A: An identity matrix in Rnxn is a matrix with 1s along its main diagonal and 0s everywhere else.

Q1: What is the definition of matrix inverse?
A1: The inverse of a square matrix A is an n×n matrix B such that AB = BA = I, where I is the identity matrix.

Q1: What is the definition of a symmetric matrix?
A1: A matrix A ∈ Rn×n is symmetric if A = A>.

Q1: What does the equation "λ(BC) = (λB)C = (BC)λ" mean?
A1: It means that the product of two matrices, BC, is equal to the product of the matrices when their order is reversed, i.e. the scalar λ can be moved around the two matrices.

Q1: What is the general form of an equation system? 
A1: a11x1 + ... + a1nxn = b1, ... , am1x1 + ... + amnxn = bm. 
Q2: What is the particular solution for the system of equations given in (2.38)? 
A2: [42, 8, 0, 0].
